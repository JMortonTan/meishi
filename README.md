# CS656 Group 1 - *NFC File Transfer*

**meishi** is an app for users to swap files over NFC using the android beam functionality.
The intention is to encourage people to swap and cherish contact cards in order to **augment** rather than replace human interaction.

We believe that technology should improve the human experience, rather than distort and replace it.
